                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <h4><strong>Born: 1918</strong></h4>
                        <h4><strong>Transkei, South Africa</strong></h4>
                        <em>South African president and political activist </em>
    
    
                        <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid
                            revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist, who served as President of South Africa from 1994
                            to 1999. He was the country's first black head of. Ideologically an African nationalist and
                            socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to
                            1997.</p>
    
    
    
                        <h4>Political prisoner </h4>
                        <p>
                            In 1962 Mandela was again arrested, this time for leaving South Africa illegally and for
                            inciting strikes. He was sentenced to five years in jail. The following year he was tried
                            with other leaders of Umkhonto weSizwe on a charge of high treason, following a
                            government raid of the group's secret headquarters. Mandela was given a life sentence,
                            which he began serving in the maximum security prison on South Africa's Robben
                            Island.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the twenty-seven years that Mandela spent in prison, his example of quiet
                            suffering was just one of many pressures on South Africa's apartheid government.
                            Public discussion of Mandela was illegal, and he was allowed few visitors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1988 Mandela was hospitalized with an illness, and after his recovery he was returned
                            to prison under somewhat less harsh conditions. By this time, the situation within South
                            Africa was becoming desperate for the ruling white powers. Protest had spread, and
                            international pressures for the end of apartheid were increasing. More and more, South
                            Africa was isolated as a racist state. It was against this backdrop that F. W. de Klerk
                            (1936–), the president of South Africa, finally responded to the calls from around the
                            world to release Mandela.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4>Freedom </h4>
                        <p>
                            On February 11, 1990, Mandela walked out of prison. He received joyful welcomes
                            wherever he went around the world. In 1991 he assumed the presidency of the ANC,
                            which had been given legal status again by the government.</p>
                        <p>
                            Both Mandela and deKlerk realized that only a compromise between whites and blacks
                            could prevent civil war in South Africa. As a result, in late 1991, a multiparty Convention
                            for a Democratic South Africa met to establish a new, democratic government that gave
                            people of all colors rights to determine the country's future. Mandela and deKlerk led
                            the negotiations, and their efforts gained them the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. In
                            September 1992, the two leaders signed a document that created a freely elected
                            constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution and to act as a transition
                            government (a government that functions temporarily while a new government is being
                            formed). On April 27, 1994, the first free elections open to all South African citizens
                            were held. The ANC won over sixty-two percent of the popular vote, and Mandela was
                            elected president.
                        </p>
    
    
                        <h4>Presidency and retirement </h4>
                        <p>
                            As president, Mandela worked to ease the dangerous political differences in his country
                            and to build up the South African economy. To a remarkable degree he was successful in
                            his aims. Mandela's skill at building compromise and his enormous personal authority
                            helped him lead the transition to democracy. In an effort to help the country heal, he
                            also backed the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission which offered
                            amnesty (exemption from criminal prosecution) to those who had committed crimes
                            during the apartheid era. This action helped to promote discussion about the country's
                            history.
